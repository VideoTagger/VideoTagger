# Importing Videos

In order to import videos to your project you will need to select `File > Import Videos` on the menubar. After that a dialog window will appear and prompt you to select video files (one or more).

Videos imported via this option will be stored in the project file as relative filepaths, which gives you the ability to share your project with others.
