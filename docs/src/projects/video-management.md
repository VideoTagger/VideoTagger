# Video Management

Videos are organized into video groups which are displayed in the `Video Group Browser`. Importing a video will automatically create a group with the same name as the video. Clicking the plus button will allow you to create a new video group. Videos can be added to a group by dragging a video from the `Video Browser` onto a group in the `Video Group Browser`.
