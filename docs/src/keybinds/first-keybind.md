# First Keybind

To add a keybind to your project, select `Tools > Options > Project Settings > Keybinds` from the menubar and press the `Add Keybind` button.

When the popup window opens you need to:
- Assign keybind's name
- Press your desired key combination
- Assign an action that should happen when the keybind is pressed

Some keybind actions have additional attributes, to learn more about them head over to [Keybind Actions](./actions.md)

<div class="warning">

There is no difference between `LeftAlt` and `RightAlt`, both are treated as a single `Alt` key - the same rule applies to `Ctrl` and `Shift` keys.

</div>

After configuring your keybind, press the `Save` button which will store the keybind in your project file.
