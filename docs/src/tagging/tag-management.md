# Tag Management

All tag related operations such as adding, modifying and removing a tag can be done via the `Tag Manager` window.

All tags shown there are stored in the project file and can be used on the `Timeline` window to create `segments` or `timestamps`. To learn more about the `Timeline` head over to [Video Timeline](./timeline.md) page.
